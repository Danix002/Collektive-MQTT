# üåç GeoChat

This application leverages the [**Collektive**](https://github.com/Collektive/collektive) **library** to model a decentralized communication system based on spatial proximity. Connected devices can send and receive messages within a global chat, provided they are within a certain distance of each other.

The project is currently under development and offers a minimal working version as a proof of concept.
